                            <p>Throughout the 2022-23 academic year, I worked as a Sophomore Advisor where I led weekly lessons helping 25 freshmen best use Texas A&M's resources to find academic and social success. I also help organize activities to help freshmen connect to professors and each other. For instance, I helped to organize a Cheers to Careers event, where we had a panel of 3 professors to answer freshmen questions. I also met with freshmen in one-on-one meetings. </p>
                            <p>After this experience, I feel more comfortable in both event planning and in leading discussions where everyone feels comfortable sharing their opinion. Especially at the beginning of the year, it was tempting for me to fill any lulls in the discussion, but over the course of the year, I learned to be more comfortable allowing more space for the group to be silent so that everyone could contribute.

                            <p>As part of a team of four, I helped create a video game in under forty-eight hours. I entirely created the art and contributed heavily towards the theme and storyline. Our game was "Heart Heist", a game similar to Plants vs. Zombies, where the player must defeat Egyptian gods in order to resurrect their son.</p>
                            <p>The judges voted our game as the game with the best sound (including the score and sound effects) out of 56 other teams.</p>

                            <p>This was another great opportunity to develop my leadership skills, especially in dealing with projects on a tight deadline where decisiveness and efficiency are important.</p>

                            <p>Over the summer of 2022, I routed twenty lab machines, and wrote penetration testing reports for each machine that explained the process necessary to attain root access as well as recommendations to improve security. </p>
                            <p>This process helped me explore a more hands-on approach to cybersecurity. After this experience, I realize I do prefer a more theoretical approach to cybersecurity, though I appreciate the problem-solving aspect of penetration testing.</p>
