                <p>Howdy!</p>
                <p>My name is Jenna Plute, and I'm a first-year PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley!
                <p>I graduated May 2025 summa cum laude from Texas A&M University with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and minors in Computer Science and Spanish. I also graduated with both the University Honors and Departmental Honors distinction as well as an Undergraduate Research Scholar for my thesis (mentored by Dr. Wencai Liu).</p>
                <p>My goal is to become a professor who researches applied mathematics or mathematical physics. To this end, I am an author on two published papers (with another in progress) on work from several REUs.</p>
                <p>Other notable accomplishments are being a National Merit Scholar, presenting at the Joint Mathematics Meetings, and being nominated for the <a href = "https://tamuhonors.wordpress.com/2024/03/27/launch-congratulates-4-nominees-for-2024-goldwater-scholarship/" style="color:Maroon;">Goldwater Scholarship</a> by Texas A&M.  </p>
