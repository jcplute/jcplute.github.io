                <p>Howdy!</p>
                <p>My name is Jenna Plute, and I'm  originally from Broomfield, Colorado. I am a fourth-year student at Texas A&M pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics, a minor in Computer Science, and both the University Honors and Departmental Honors distinction.</p>
                <p>My goal is to become a professor who researches applied mathematics or mathematical physics. To this end, I have published two papers (with another in progress), where the work stems from several REUs.</p>
                <p>Other notable accomplishments are being a National Merit Scholar, presenting at the Joint Mathematics Meetings, and being nominated for the (<a href = "https://tamuhonors.wordpress.com/2024/03/27/launch-congratulates-4-nominees-for-2024-goldwater-scholarship/">Goldwater Scholarship</a>) by Texas A&M.  </p>   
                <p>For anyone interested, I will also be presenting at the 2025 Joint Mathematics Meetings, Pi Mu Epsilon Contributed Session IV, Thursday January 9, 2025 @5pm! </p>
