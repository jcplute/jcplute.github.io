                <i>Summer 2024</i>
                <i>Mentor: Kelly Jabbusch</i>
                <p>As part of the REU program at University of Michigan - Dearborn, I and three other undergraduates (Lauren Engelthaler, Jacob Gathje, and Izzy Pfaff) investigated error correcting codes derived from toric varieties and found 
                    the minimum distance for a certain infinite class of codes. We also proved several theorems relating the minimum distance of a toric code to its Minkowski length (a geometric
                    invariant of the polytope the code is associated with).  </p>

                <i>Mentors: Wencai Liu, Matthew Faust, Rodrigo Matos</i>
                <p>During the 2022-23 academic year, I worked with Dr. Wencai Liu, Dr. Rodrigo Matos, and Matthew Faust and several other undergraduates (Jonah Robinson, Yichen Tao, Ethan Tran, and Cindy Zhuang) on math research relating to finding solutions for inverse Schrodinger operators.

                <i>Summer 2022</i>
                <p>I worked for the Urban.AI Lab at Texas A&M University as a research assistant, where I processed and labeled satellite imagery data for use with artificial intelligence as well as conducted a literature review of 1,000+ research papers to determine trends in applications of AI to urban processes. 
Through this experience, I was able to develop my Excel skills, especially in pivot tables and sorting data, as well as my skills in virtual collaboration, as all team meetings and trainings were held through Zoom. </p>
