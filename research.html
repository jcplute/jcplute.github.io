                <p><i>Fall 2024-Spring 2025</i></p>
                <p><i>Mentor: Wencai Liu</i></p>
                <p>As part of the URS program at Texas A&M, I worked with Dr. Liu on an undergraduate thesis. This paper provides a treatment of the mathematics behind periodic Schrödinger operators and proves that for an exponentially decaying potential, the one-dimensional periodic Schröodinger operator has no embedded eigenvalues.  </p>

                <p><i>Summer 2024</i></p>
                <p><i>Mentor: Kelly Jabbusch</i></p>
                <p>As part of the REU program at University of Michigan - Dearborn, I and three other undergraduates (Eliza Hogan, Amelia Gibbs, and Nicholas Toloczko) investigated error correcting codes derived from toric varieties and found 
                    the minimum distance for a certain infinite class of codes. We also proved several theorems relating the minimum distance of a toric code to its Minkowski length (a geometric
                    invariant of the polytope the code is associated with).  </p>

                <h3 style="color:Maroon;">Sandpile group of intersection graphs</h3>
                <p><i>Summer 2023</i></p>
                <p><i>Mentors: Joshua Ducey, Brant Jones</i></p>
                <p>As part of the REU program at James Madison University, I and three other undergraduates (Lauren Engelthaler, Jacob Gathje, and Isabel Pfaff) found the sandpile group of intersection graphs. 
The specific question we began with was finding the sandpile group of Kneser graphs with 3 subsets. This was essentially diagonalizing an arbitrarily large matrix. After implementing past work by Wilson and Bier,  we discovered that the same technique applied to intersection graphs in general, not just this particular case, which was a major shift in scope.  
                    Our process then generalizes to find a diagonal form of the adjacency matrix of all intersection graphs as well (an infinite class of graphs).</p>

                <p>I worked with Dr. Wencai Liu, Dr. Rodrigo Matos, Matthew Faust and several other undergraduates (Jonah Robinson, Yichen Tao, Ethan Tran, and Cindy Zhuang) on math research relating to finding solutions for inverse Schrodinger operators.
